The fourth cycle of capitalist accumulation began in the middle of the first world war. The United States had been a latent economic power before then, but had lacked power projection into Europe. During and after the war, New York City, and particularly <i>Wall Street</i>, became the centre of global finance
<br><br>
During the second world war, American financial and military power reached it's  peak with the establishment of the <i>IMF</i> at the <i>Breton Woods agreement</i>. Immediately after the war, the American economy made up <i>50% of the world's GDP</i> and owned <i>80%</i> of the world's gold reserves
<br><br>
The post-war era saw the development and proliferation of US multinational corporations, which were only possible at the scale they operated on because of the global free trade system which the US had brought to the world during the war.
<br><br>
After a boom period lasting from the end of WW2 until the 1970s, the US industrial system fell into crisis and the American economy began to shift from industrial production to the financialised system we have in the modern day. The gold standard was dropped, which combined with the US dollar's value being boosted by it's world currency status allowed the US to spend without any functional limit. This capitalist system is the modern one under which we live today
