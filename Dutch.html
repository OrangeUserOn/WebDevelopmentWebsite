	The Dutch, a small, oppressed nation that had been a part of the Hapsburg empire for a couple centuries, overthrew their oppressor and began a period of prolonged warfare. Despite this, they managed to create a great empire, extending from the ports of the North Sea to the vast stretches of the Indian Ocean, encompassing key outposts in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.

	<Div class="main">Amsterdam became the heart of this burgeoning empire. The establishment of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) exemplified their sophisticated approach to trade and finance, as it became one of the first multinational corporations and significantly boosted Dutch economic power.

	The Dutch also developed the use of public debt, creating a model of financial stability that supported their extensive commercial activities. The Dutch were pioneers in developing modern financial instruments, which facilitated the efficient flow of money-capital and investment into their small homeland, making it one of the most developed places in the western world (at this point, China and India's sheer size still beat out the capitalist efficiency of relatively tiny European powers). Their financial innovations attracted capital from across Europe, creating Amsterdam's position as the centre of global finance

	Just like the Genoese the Dutch began to prioritize finance over their other economic activities. Amsterdam's stock exchange became the central institution, driving economic growth. The Dutch financial system supported not only their commercial ventures but also the constant military campaigns that they were forced into because of their bordering their Hapsburg rivals. This transition from productive dominance in trade and manufacturing to a focus on financial activities marked the peak and subsequent decline of Dutch hegemony. By the late 18th century, the British had begun to eclipse the Dutch, heralding the next phase of capitalist accumulation.
