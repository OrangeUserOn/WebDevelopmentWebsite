<p class="title">The British Cycle</p>
<p class="subtitle">VOLUME III. | Capitalist Cycle | Late 18th Century - early 1900s</p>

The British cycle began in the late 18th century, marking the United Kingdom's rise as the world's leading industrial and colonial power. The onset of the Industrial Revolution transformed Britain into an economic powerhouse, driven by innovations in technology, manufacturing, and transportation. The British excelled in producing goods on an unprecedented scale, dominating industries such as textiles, steel, and shipbuilding.

London emerged as the epicenter of this expanding empire, evolving into the world's preeminent financial center. The British had pioneered modern financial practices, notably fractional reserve banking (wherein the bank only has to have a portion of the deposited money avaliable to withdraw). The City of London became the hub for international finance, acting as the nexus of global investment.

The British Empire extended its reach across the world, establishing colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. This vast colonial network provided essential raw materials for British industries and served as markets for British manufactured goods, as well as producing numerous colonial atrocities and costly wars. The Royal Navy played a crucial role in securing sea routes and protecting British commercial interests, ensuring the smooth flow of goods and capital.

Like the Genoese and Dutch before them, the British began to prioritize finance over their other economic activities. By the early 1900s British industry had began to stagnate, especially compared to the rising stars of America and Germany. British banks and financial institutions stayed strong, however, and faciliated global trade and investment, reinforcing London's status as the world's financial capital. It would remain so until the Great War thrust the Empire into a titanic struggle, in which the financial, economic, and military resources of the British Empire would be exhausted, eventually allowing the United States to rise in it's place.
